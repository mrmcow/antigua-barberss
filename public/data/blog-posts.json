Knowing these terms will earn you respect in the chair.\n\n### Key Terms\n*   **\"Marking\" / \"Shape Up\":** What Americans call a \"Line Up\" or \"Edge Up\". The crisp outline of the hairline.\n*   **\"Lowie\":** A low fade or low cut.\n*   **\"Skin\":** Bald. If you ask for a \"Skin Fade\", you are getting a bald fade.\n*   **\"Trim\":** Usually means a full haircut, not just a small adjustment.\n*   **\"Dark\":** Keeping the hair heavy/thick, usually referring to the fade transition (e.g., \"Keep the fade dark\").\n\n### The \"Vex\" Factor\nAntiguan barbers are artists, but they can be blunt. If they say your hair is \"hard\", they mean the texture is coarse. It's not an insult, just a technical observation.\n\n### The Greeting\nAlways say **\"Good morning/afternoon/night\"** when entering a shop. A simple nod isn't enough in Caribbean culture. It's a sign of respect to the room.\n    \n",

Expect scissors and simple trims rather than razor-sharp street fades.\n\n### The \"Real\" Option\nFor a proper fade or detailed beard work, you are better off leaving the gates.\n*   **Nearby:** St. John's is a 10-minute taxi ride ($15 USD).\n*   **Recommended:** Head to a shop in **Crosbies** or **upper St. John's** for high-quality service at half the price.\n\n### Mobile Service to Sandals?\nSecurity at Sandals is strict.

It looks more natural, and any skin irritation has time to settle.\n\n### Booking for the Groomsmen\nIf you have a party of 4-5 guys, **book a mobile barber** to come to the groom's suite.\n*   **Vibe:** It settles the nerves, creates a cool photo op, and keeps everyone on schedule.\n*   **Cost:** Negotiate a \"Package Deal\" (e.g., $200 USD for 5 heads + travel).\n\n### The \"Tropical\" Factor\nAntigua is humid.\n*   **Hair:** Frizz happens.

We categorize barbers into two zones for cruise passengers:\n\n### 1. The Walking Zone (5-15 mins)\nThese shops are located in downtown St. John's, directly inland from Heritage Quay and Redcliffe Quay. \n\n**Pros:**\n*   **Zero traffic risk:** You walk there, you walk back.\n*   **Predictable:** You know exactly how long the return trip takes.\n*   **Vibe:** You get to see the real St. John's streets, not just the duty-free mall.\n\n**Cons:**\n*   Limited options compared to the whole island.\n*   Can be busy on days with 3+ ships in port.\n\n**Top Pick Strategy:** Look for shops near *Market Street* or *High Street*. Avoid wandering too far north of the market unless you know where you're going.\n\n### 2. The Taxi Zone (10-20 min ride)\nThis opens up options further out, like on All Saints Road or near the outskirts of the city.\n\n**Pros:**\n*   **Higher quality options:** Some of the island's best \"Instagram-famous\" barbers are a short drive away.\n*   **Less crowded:** Fewer tourists, more locals.\n\n**Cons:**\n*   **Traffic risk:** St. John's traffic can get deadlocked, especially around 3-4 PM when schools get out and government offices close.\n*   **Cost:** Factor in $10-20 USD for the taxi each way.\n\n## The 2-Hour Rule\n\nWe preach one rule for cruise passengers: **Always allow a 2-hour buffer.**\n\nIf your ship leaves at 5:00 PM (all aboard 4:30 PM), do not book an appointment later than 2:30 PM. \n\nWhy?\n1.  **Haircuts take time:** A quality fade isn't a 15-minute job. Allow 45-60 mins for the service.\n2.  **Queues happen:** Even with an appointment, you might wait 10-15 minutes.\n3.  **Walking back:** You want to grab a beer at the port, not sprint down the pier.\n\n## Cash is King (But USD Works)\n\nMost barbers in St. John's accept US Dollars (USD), but the exchange rate usually given is **$2.70 EC to $1 USD** (official is roughly 2.70).\n\n*   **Tip:** Bring small bills ($5s, $10s, $20s).\n*   **Don't expect credit card machines:** They are rare in local shops.\n*   **ATMs:** There are several reliable ATMs near Heritage Quay if you need local currency (EC$), but USD is universally welcomed.\n\n## How to Book\n\nWalk-ins are common in the Caribbean, but on a cruise day with 10,000 passengers, the best shops fill up.\n\n1.  **Check our directory:** Use the \"Near Port\" filter on our [Browse Page](/browse).\n2.  **WhatsApp is better than calling:** Most Antiguan barbers live on WhatsApp. Drop them a message: *\"Hi, I'm on the Royal Caribbean ship, docking tomorrow. Do you have a slot at 10 AM?\"*\n3.  **Mention your hard stop time:** Tell the barber immediately when you sit down: *\"I need to be leaving here by 1:00 PM.\"* They will respect it.\n\n## Summary\n\nGetting a haircut in Antigua is a great way to escape the tourist trap bubble and connect with locals. The barbers are skilled, the conversation is good, and you'll look sharp for the formal night on board.\n\nJust stick to the **Walking Zone** if you're nervous about time, and always respect the **2-Hour Rule**.\n\n*Ready to find your cut?
