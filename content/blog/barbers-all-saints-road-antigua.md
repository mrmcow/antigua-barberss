## The Real Barber Scene

If you want to see where the locals actually get cut, head to All Saints Road. This stretch is the heartbeat of Antiguan grooming culture. It's not about luxury spas; it's about sharp fades, loud debates about cricket and politics, and unbeatable prices.

### Why Go Here?
*   **Authenticity:** This is 100% Antigua. No filtered tourist experience.
*   **Skill:** These barbers cut hundreds of heads a week. Their fade game is elite.
*   **Price:** Expect to pay standard local rates ($30-$40 EC), significantly less than resort prices.

### Key Spots to Look For
Keep your eyes peeled as you drive south from St. John's. The shops are often small, painted in bright colors, and busy from morning til night.

> **Local Tip:** Parking can be tricky. Be prepared to park on a side street and walk a minute.
