## Wedding Ready in Paradise

You spent thousands on the venue and the suits. Don't ruin the photos with a 3-week-old haircut. Getting the whole groomsmen party sharp is a standard part of the Antigua wedding experience.

### The Mobile "Suite" Experience
The best move is to book a mobile barber to come to your getting-ready suite.
*   **Timing:** Book them for the morning of the wedding, at least 4 hours before photos start.
*   **Logistics:** You provide the chairs and power; they bring the skills.
*   **Drinks:** It's customary (and fun) to offer the barber a drink once the blades are put away.

### Booking Advice
*   **Advance Notice:** Good mobile barbers book up weeks in advance, especially during wedding season (Nov - May).
*   **Deposit:** Expect to pay a deposit to secure the block of time.
*   **Style Consistency:** Send photos of the desired look beforehand so the barber brings the right tools.
