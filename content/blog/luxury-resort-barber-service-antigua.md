You're paying $500+ per night. Your resort has a spa, three pools, and butler service. But when you need a fresh haircut for dinner at the fine dining restaurant, the concierge suggests you "go into town."

Not ideal.

## Resort Concierge Coordination

### What to Tell Your Concierge

Most resort concierges can arrange transportation and coordinate timing. Here's what to ask for:

**"Can you arrange a taxi to [Barber Name] in St. John's at [Time], with pickup at [Time + 1.5 hours]?"**

**Example:** *"Can you arrange a taxi to Head Liners Men Studio at 2 PM, with pickup at 3:30 PM?"*

This gives you:
- 1 hour for the actual service
- 30 minutes buffer for conversation and travel

### Premium Service Expectations

**What you should expect:**
- **Clean, air-conditioned shops** (not all Antigua barbers have AC - ask ahead)
- **English-speaking barbers** (standard in tourist areas)
- **Professional equipment** and high-quality products
- **Credit card acceptance** (rare, but some upscale shops do)

## Pricing for Resort Guests

**Mobile Service:** $60-80 USD (includes travel)
**Premium Shops:** $35-45 USD (plus $10-20 taxi each way)
**Standard Shops:** $25-35 USD (plus transportation)

**Tipping:** 15-20% is appreciated, especially for mobile service

## Timing Your Cut

### Best Times to Book
- **Morning (9-11 AM):** Shops are fresh, less crowded
- **Early afternoon (1-3 PM):** Avoid lunch rush and school pickup times  
- **Avoid 4-6 PM:** Traffic and end-of-workday rush

### Seasonal Considerations
- **High season (Dec-Apr):** Book 1-2 days ahead
- **Cruise days:** Check [Heritage Quay schedule](https://antiguaports.gov.ag) - avoid peak passenger times
