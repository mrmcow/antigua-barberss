## Fade Types Explained (Antigua Style)

**Low Fade:** Starts just above the ears. Classic and professional.
**Mid Fade:** Starts around the temples. Most popular choice.  
**High Fade:** Starts near the top. Bold and modern.
**Skin Fade:** Blends down to completely bare skin. Requires expert skill.

## Booking Tips for Tourists

1. **WhatsApp first:** Text the shop with your ship departure time
2. **Cash ready:** Bring $25-35 USD for a quality fade
3. **Reference photo:** Show them exactly what you want - don't assume they know "medium fade"
