Your flight lands at 2 PM. The wedding starts at 6 PM. Your hair looks like you've been backpacking through Central America for three weeks.

Don't panic. Antigua's barbers understand urgency.

Here's your emergency game plan for getting a quality cut when time is tight.

## The "SOS" Strategy

### Step 1: Location Check (2 minutes)
**Where are you right now?**

- **St. John's/Cruise Port:** Walk to Market Street or High Street
- **Airport area:** Take a taxi to St. John's (10 mins)  
- **Jolly Harbour:** All Saints Road has multiple options
- **English Harbour:** Limited but doable

### Step 2: The WhatsApp Blitz (5 minutes)
**Message 3-4 shops simultaneously:**

*"Hi, I need a haircut ASAP. Can you fit me in the next 2 hours? I'm [location]. Thanks!"*

**Pro shops for emergency cuts:**
- **Don's Barber Beauty Salon:** [WhatsApp Link](/barbers/3bd12f68-f0b1-4e9f-8737-f04647a4aec9) (5★, great with urgency)

## The 45-Minute Rule

**Real talk:** A proper haircut takes 45-60 minutes in the Caribbean. Barbers don't rush quality.

But for **true emergencies**, these barbers can deliver a solid cut in 30 minutes:

1. **Tell them it's urgent** when you walk in
2. **Bring a reference photo** - saves 10 minutes of explanation  
3. **Tip well** ($10-15 USD) - they're accommodating your emergency
4. **Keep it simple** - basic fade or trim, not experimental

## Emergency Cut Types That Work

**✅ DO Request:**
- **Classic fade** (low, mid, or high)
- **Shape-up** (clean up existing cut)
- **Buzz cut** with fade sides
- **Basic trim** (take length off, clean the edges)

**❌ DON'T Request:**
- Complex designs or patterns  
- First-time dramatic style changes
- Multiple services (cut + beard + eyebrows)

## Payment & Tips for Rush Jobs

**Cash is fastest:** Have exact change ready ($25-35 USD)
**Tip generously:** 20-25% for emergency accommodation  
**NO haggling:** Pay the quoted price - you're asking for a favor

## Absolute Last Resort: Hotel/Resort Barbers

**Some resorts have barbers on-call:**
- **Sandals Grande:** Ask concierge about "grooming services"
- **Curtain Bluff:** Sometimes has visiting barbers
- **Jolly Beach:** May arrange mobile service

**Cost:** $80-120 USD (resort premium), but guaranteed quality

## Post-Cut Checklist

Before you leave the shop:
- ✅ **Check all angles** in the mirror
- ✅ **Ask for product recommendations** (humidity is real in Antigua)  
- ✅ **Get the barber's WhatsApp** for next time
- ✅ **Take a selfie** - you'll want to remember who hooked you up

## Success Stories

*"Landed at 1 PM for a 6 PM wedding. Don's Barber Beauty Salon had me looking fresh by 3 PM. Saved my entire trip."* - **Resort Guest, December 2024**

*"Ship was leaving at 5 PM. Mobay Barbershop fit me in at 2:30 PM even though they were packed. Professional and fast."* - **Cruise Passenger, November 2024**

## Your Emergency Action Plan

1. **Check your location** (which neighborhood?)
2. **WhatsApp 3 shops** simultaneously  
3. **Head to the first one** that responds
4. **Have cash ready** and **tip well**
5. **Keep it simple** - fade or trim only

**Remember:** Antigua barbers are used to helping tourists in time crunches. Be respectful, tip fairly, and they'll take care of you.
