## Resort vs. Real World

Sandals Grande Antigua (Dickenson Bay) has an on-site spa (Red Lane® Spa) that offers men's grooming.

### The On-Site Option
*   **Pros:** You don't have to leave the resort. AC is guaranteed.
*   **Cons:** Expensive. It's "Spa Grooming," not a "Barber Shop" vibe. Expect scissors and simple trims rather than razor-sharp street fades.

### The "Real" Option
For a proper fade or detailed beard work, you are better off leaving the gates.
*   **Nearby:** St. John's is a 10-minute taxi ride ($15 USD).
*   **Recommended:** Head to a shop in **Crosbies** or **upper St. John's** for high-quality service at half the price.

### Mobile Service to Sandals?
Security at Sandals is strict. Most outside mobile barbers cannot access guest rooms unless they are pre-approved vendors. It is easier to meet them just outside or take a quick taxi.
