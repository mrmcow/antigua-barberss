## Don't Risk the Wedding Photos

Getting married at a resort or on the beach? You need to look sharp.

### The Timing Rule
**Do NOT get your haircut on the wedding day.**
*   **Why?** If they push your hairline back or nick you, you have zero recovery time.
*   **The Fix:** Get your cut **2 days before**. It looks more natural, and any skin irritation has time to settle.

### Booking for the Groomsmen
If you have a party of 4-5 guys, **book a mobile barber** to come to the groom's suite.
*   **Vibe:** It settles the nerves, creates a cool photo op, and keeps everyone on schedule.
*   **Cost:** Negotiate a "Package Deal" (e.g., $200 USD for 5 heads + travel).

### The "Tropical" Factor
Antigua is humid.
*   **Hair:** Frizz happens. Go slightly shorter than usual.
*   **Beard:** Use oil. The salt air and sun will dry it out quickly.
