## The Community Parliament

In Antigua, the barbershop is third base. First is home, second is work, third is the shop. It's where news travels faster than on the radio.

### The Atmosphere
*   **Loud & Proud:** Expect lively debates about cricket, football (soccer), and local politics.
*   **Music:** Dancehall, Soca, and Reggae are standard. It keeps the energy high.
*   **The "Liming":** You'll see guys hanging out who aren't even getting cuts. They're just there for the vibe. This is normal.

### How to Participate
*   **Respect the Chair:** When you're in the chair, you're the focus, but the conversation includes everyone.
*   **Join In:** Don't be afraid to laugh or drop a comment. You'll be respected for engaging rather than sitting on your phone in silence.
*   **The Fist Bump:** The standard greeting and goodbye.

It's raw, it's real, and it's one of the best ways to experience authentic Antigua.
