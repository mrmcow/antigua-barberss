## Know the Rates Before You Sit Down

Prices in Antigua vary significantly based on location (Town vs. Resort areas) and the shop's amenities (AC vs. Fan).

Here is the 2025 baseline so you know if you're getting a fair deal.

### Standard Shop Rates (St. John's / Local Areas)
*   **Regular Men's Cut:** $30 - $40 XCD ($11 - $15 USD)
*   **Fade / Taper:** $40 - $50 XCD ($15 - $19 USD)
*   **Shape Up / Line Up:** $15 - $25 XCD ($6 - $10 USD)
*   **Beard Trim:** $20 - $30 XCD ($8 - $11 USD)

### "Tourist" / Resort Area Rates (Jolly Harbour / English Harbour)
Expect to pay a premium for location and English-speaking staff accustomed to tourist styles.
*   **Men's Cut:** $60 - $100 XCD ($25 - $40 USD)
*   **Full Service (Cut + Beard + Towel):** $135+ XCD ($50+ USD)

### Mobile Barber Rates
Convenience is the most expensive option.
*   **House Call Fee:** Usually $50 - $100 XCD ($20 - $40 USD) *on top of the haircut price*.

### Warning Signs
*   If a barber quotes you in USD and it sounds like US prices ($40 USD for a basic cut in a local shop), ask for the EC price.
*   **Always confirm the price before the cape goes on.**
