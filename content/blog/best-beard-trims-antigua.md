## Respect the Beard

A haircut grows back in two weeks. A messed-up beard takes months. We know the stakes.

### What to Look For
In Antigua, look for older, established barbershops for beard work. The "young gun" shops often focus purely on fades.

### The Hot Towel Rareness
A true hot towel shave is a premium service in Antigua and not standard in $20 XCD shops. You will find this mostly in:
*   **English Harbour:** Yachting-focused shops.
*   **Upscale St. John's:** Shops catering to businessmen and politicians.

### Top Picks for Beards
1.  **Director's Cut (Liberta):** Known for precision and patience.
2.  **Any "Old School" shop in Market Street:** Ask for the "Senior Barber".
