## The Yachting Hub

English Harbour and Falmouth Harbour are distinct from the rest of the island. The demand here is high during the season (December - May), driven by yacht crews and charter guests.

### The Season Factor
During the boat show or sailing week, barbers from Town often set up pop-up spots or offer dedicated mobile services to the docks.

### Local Spots in Liberta & All Saints
If you can't find a spot right on the dock, a quick 10-minute drive up to Liberta or All Saints opens up authentic local options. These are often the barbers who service the local workforce of the dockyard.

### Style Watch
*   **Crew Cuts:** Practical, low-maintenance styles are popular.
*   **Beard Work:** High demand for beard trimming and shaping before charter guests arrive.
