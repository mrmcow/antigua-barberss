## Fresh Cuts for the Little Ones

Antiguan culture takes pride in well-groomed kids, especially for school and church. As a result, many barbers here are experts at handling squirming toddlers and nervous first-timers.

### What to Look For
*   **Patience:** The hallmark of a good kids' barber.
*   **Environment:** Some shops can be loud/explicit. Look for "family-friendly" tags or morning slots which are generally quieter.
*   **Treats:** Some shops keep lollipops on deck – the universal language of cooperation.

### Top Areas for Families
**Friars Hill Road** and **Old Parham Road** areas often have shops with easier parking and more spacious waiting areas, making the family trip less stressful than fighting downtown traffic.
