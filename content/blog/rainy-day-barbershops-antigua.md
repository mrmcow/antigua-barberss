Here's where to go when the skies open up.

## Why Rainy Days Are Perfect for Haircuts

## Rainy Day Barber Etiquette

### What Locals Do
- **Bring a towel** for your shoulders (some shops provide them)
- **Don't shake water** all over the shop when you enter  
- **Order something** if there's a snackette attached
- **Take your time** - no need to rush back into the rain

### Tourist Tips
- **WhatsApp ahead:** *"Coming in from the rain, will be there in 10 minutes"*
- **Bring entertainment:** Download a podcast - rainy day cuts are relaxed  
- **Cash ready:** You might be there longer, tip accordingly
- **Embrace the experience:** This is authentic Caribbean life

## What to Expect

**The vibe changes on rainy days:**
- **More conversation:** Barbers and customers have time to chat
- **Relaxed pace:** No one's rushing to get anywhere
- **Community feel:** You might end up staying an hour just talking
- **Local insights:** Best time to ask about restaurants, beaches, hidden spots

## Rainy Day Specials

Some barbershops offer **"Weather Wait" deals:**
- **Extended services:** Beard trim + eyebrow cleanup included
- **Product trials:** Try new pomades or styling products  
- **Photo sessions:** Great lighting for showing off the fresh cut

*Ask when you book: "Do you have any rainy day specials?"*

## Neighborhoods That Stay Busy

**St. John's remains active** - government offices, banks, businesses stay open
**All Saints Road** - main commercial strip, always has foot traffic
**Market Street area** - locals still need groceries and essentials

**Avoid on rainy days:** Beach-adjacent areas (everyone moves inland)

## The Perfect Rainy Day Barber Experience

1. **WhatsApp your chosen shop:** Give them a 30-minute heads up
2. **Taxi there:** Don't walk in the rain with freshly cut hair planned  
3. **Order a drink:** If there's a snackette, support the local business
4. **Embrace the timing:** Let them take their time - you're not going anywhere
5. **Learn something new:** Ask about local life, recommendations, stories

## Emergency Rain Gear

**What shops usually have:**
- Basic towels for drying off
- Umbrellas (ask to borrow for the walk back)
- Plastic covers for protecting your fresh cut

**What to bring:**
- Light jacket or hoodie
- Small towel
- Patience and good humor
