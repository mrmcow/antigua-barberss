## The Sunday Shutdown

Antigua is a deeply religious island. Most businesses, including barbershops, are closed on Sundays.

### Your Options
1.  **The "Town" Hustlers:** Some shops near the West Bus Station in St. John's open on Sundays, typically from 10 AM to 2 PM.
2.  **Resort Areas:** Barbershops in English Harbour (during sailing season) may open on Sundays to service yacht crews.
3.  **Mobile Barbers:** This is your best bet. Many barbers do house calls on their day off for an extra fee.

### Saturday Rush
Because Sunday is closed, **Saturday is chaos**.
*   **Wait Times:** 1-2 hours minimum for walk-ins.
*   **Strategy:** Go as early as possible (7 AM or 8 AM) or book an appointment mid-week.
