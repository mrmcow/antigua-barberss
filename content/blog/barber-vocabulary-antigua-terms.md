## Don't Get Lost in Translation

While English is the official language, Antigua has its own dialect and barbering terminology. Knowing these terms will earn you respect in the chair.

### Key Terms
*   **"Marking" / "Shape Up":** What Americans call a "Line Up" or "Edge Up". The crisp outline of the hairline.
*   **"Lowie":** A low fade or low cut.
*   **"Skin":** Bald. If you ask for a "Skin Fade", you are getting a bald fade.
*   **"Trim":** Usually means a full haircut, not just a small adjustment.
*   **"Dark":** Keeping the hair heavy/thick, usually referring to the fade transition (e.g., "Keep the fade dark").

### The "Vex" Factor
Antiguan barbers are artists, but they can be blunt. If they say your hair is "hard", they mean the texture is coarse. It's not an insult, just a technical observation.

### The Greeting
Always say **"Good morning/afternoon/night"** when entering a shop. A simple nod isn't enough in Caribbean culture. It's a sign of respect to the room.
