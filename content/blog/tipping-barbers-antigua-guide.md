## The Short Answer: Yes, but it's optional.

Unlike the US where 20% is mandatory survival money, tipping in Antigua is a gesture of appreciation. However, for service industry professionals like barbers who often rent their chairs, it is highly appreciated.

### How Much is Standard?
*   **Standard Cut:** $5 - $10 XCD ($2 - $4 USD)
*   **Complex Fade / Design:** $15 - $25 XCD ($5 - $10 USD)
*   **Mobile Service:** $25+ XCD ($10+ USD) - *Always tip mobile barbers more for the travel time.*

### USD or EC (XCD)?
Both are accepted everywhere.
*   **The "Street" Rate:** Most shops use 2.70 EC to 1 USD.
*   **Ideally:** Tip in the same currency you pay with to keep it simple.

### When NOT to Tip
If the barber was late, rushed you, or ignored your requests, do not feel obligated to tip. Antiguan culture respects directness.

> **Pro Tip:** If you're a regular visitor or staying for a while, a good tip on the first visit guarantees you the VIP slot next time.
