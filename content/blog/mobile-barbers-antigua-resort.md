## The Ultimate Vacation Luxury

You're in Antigua to relax. Fighting traffic into St. John's might not be on your agenda. Luckily, Antigua has a thriving community of mobile barbers who specialize in villa and resort calls.

### How it Works
1.  **Find a Mobile-Verified Barber:** Filter our directory for "Mobile Service".
2.  **WhatsApp is Key:** Don't email. Send a WhatsApp message with:
    *   Your exact Google Maps location (pin drop).
    *   Service needed.
    *   Preferred time.
3.  **Gate Access:** If you are in **Jolly Harbour**, **Galley Bay**, or **St. James's Club**, you *must* arrange gate access for the barber. Tell security a guest is coming.

### What to Provide
*   **A Chair:** A regular dining chair works fine.
*   **Lighting:** Pick a spot on the patio with good natural light or a well-lit bathroom.
*   **Power:** They will need an outlet for clippers (unless they are fully cordless).

### Who to Book?
We verify mobile barbers for reliability. Look for the "Mobile" badge on profiles.

> **Safety Note:** Our listed mobile barbers are vetted professionals. We do not list random freelancers without a track record.
