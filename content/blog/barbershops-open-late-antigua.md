## After-Hours Grooming

Most barbershops in Antigua close by 6 PM, but a few understand that working people need flexibility. Here's where to get a quality cut when the sun goes down.

### Late-Night Champions

### The Evening Rush (5-7 PM)

Most shops get their second wave around 5 PM when people finish work. This is actually prime time:
- **Better conversation** - less rushed than lunch hour
- **Cooler temperatures** - more comfortable in the shop
- **Weekend prep** - everyone getting fresh for Friday night

### Call Ahead Strategy

Evening hours can be informal. Your best bet:
1. **Call directly** - most barbers will stay for good customers
2. **WhatsApp message** - many shops respond quickly 
3. **Check weekends** - Friday/Saturday often have extended hours

### Mobile Service After Dark

Several barbers offer mobile service for evening appointments at your hotel or villa. This works especially well for:
- **Resort guests** who can't make it to town
- **Wedding parties** preparing for events
- **Groups** needing multiple cuts

## Quick Evening Cut Checklist

✅ **Call first** - don't assume they're open  
✅ **Be ready to wait** - evening is social time  
✅ **Bring cash** - some shops prefer cash for late appointments  
✅ **Join the conversation** - evening vibe is more relaxed

The barbershop after work hits different. It's where the day's stress melts away with a hot towel and sharp conversation.
