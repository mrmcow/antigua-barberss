## Masters of Texture

If you have afro-textured hair, you know the anxiety of finding a new barber while traveling. In Europe or parts of the US, it can be a gamble. In Antigua, it's the standard.

### The Skill Level
Antiguan barbers train on coarse and curly hair from day one. They understand:
*   **Grain Direction:** Essential for avoiding razor bumps.
*   **Line Ups:** We take the hairline *very* seriously here. Crisp is the only acceptable standard.
*   **Skin Fades:** The blending techniques here are world-class.

### Best Services to Try
Since you're in expert hands, try something new:
*   **Sponge Twists:** Many shops specialize in curling sponge styling.
*   **Beard Sculpting:** It's an art form here. Hot towel treatments combined with razor lining.

Don't stress about your hair before your trip. The best cut of your year might be waiting for you in St. John's.
