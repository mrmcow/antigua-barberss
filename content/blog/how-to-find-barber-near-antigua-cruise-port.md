You’ve just docked at Heritage Quay. You have 6 hours before the ship leaves. Your hair is a mess from three days at sea, and you want a fresh fade before dinner tonight.

But you have questions:
*   *How far is it to a decent shop?*
*   *Will I get back in time?*
*   *Do they take US dollars?*

This guide breaks down exactly how to find a barber in St. John's without the stress.

## The "Safe Zone": Walking Distance vs. Taxi

Antigua is relaxed ("Island Time" is real), but your ship's schedule isn't. We categorize barbers into two zones for cruise passengers:

### 1. The Walking Zone (5-15 mins)
These shops are located in downtown St. John's, directly inland from Heritage Quay and Redcliffe Quay. 

**Pros:**
*   **Zero traffic risk:** You walk there, you walk back.
*   **Predictable:** You know exactly how long the return trip takes.
*   **Vibe:** You get to see the real St. John's streets, not just the duty-free mall.

**Cons:**
*   Limited options compared to the whole island.
*   Can be busy on days with 3+ ships in port.

**Top Pick Strategy:** Look for shops near *Market Street* or *High Street*. Avoid wandering too far north of the market unless you know where you're going.

### 2. The Taxi Zone (10-20 min ride)
This opens up options further out, like on All Saints Road or near the outskirts of the city.

**Pros:**
*   **Higher quality options:** Some of the island's best "Instagram-famous" barbers are a short drive away.
*   **Less crowded:** Fewer tourists, more locals.

**Cons:**
*   **Traffic risk:** St. John's traffic can get deadlocked, especially around 3-4 PM when schools get out and government offices close.
*   **Cost:** Factor in $10-20 USD for the taxi each way.

## The 2-Hour Rule

We preach one rule for cruise passengers: **Always allow a 2-hour buffer.**

If your ship leaves at 5:00 PM (all aboard 4:30 PM), do not book an appointment later than 2:30 PM. 

Why?
1.  **Haircuts take time:** A quality fade isn't a 15-minute job. Allow 45-60 mins for the service.
2.  **Queues happen:** Even with an appointment, you might wait 10-15 minutes.
3.  **Walking back:** You want to grab a beer at the port, not sprint down the pier.

## Cash is King (But USD Works)

Most barbers in St. John's accept US Dollars (USD), but the exchange rate usually given is **$2.70 EC to $1 USD** (official is roughly 2.70).

*   **Tip:** Bring small bills ($5s, $10s, $20s).
*   **Don't expect credit card machines:** They are rare in local shops.
*   **ATMs:** There are several reliable ATMs near Heritage Quay if you need local currency (EC$), but USD is universally welcomed.

## How to Book

Walk-ins are common in the Caribbean, but on a cruise day with 10,000 passengers, the best shops fill up.

1.  **Check our directory:** Use the "Near Port" filter on our [Browse Page](/browse).
2.  **WhatsApp is better than calling:** Most Antiguan barbers live on WhatsApp. Drop them a message: *"Hi, I'm on the Royal Caribbean ship, docking tomorrow. Do you have a slot at 10 AM?"*
3.  **Mention your hard stop time:** Tell the barber immediately when you sit down: *"I need to be leaving here by 1:00 PM."* They will respect it.

## Summary

Getting a haircut in Antigua is a great way to escape the tourist trap bubble and connect with locals. The barbers are skilled, the conversation is good, and you'll look sharp for the formal night on board.

Just stick to the **Walking Zone** if you're nervous about time, and always respect the **2-Hour Rule**.
