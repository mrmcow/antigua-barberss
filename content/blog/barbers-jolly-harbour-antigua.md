## West Coast Grooming

Jolly Harbour is a major hub for expats and tourists, but the barber scene is a bit more hidden than in Town. You often have to look into the nearby village of Bolans or catch a mobile barber.

### The Bolans Connection
Just outside the gates of Jolly Harbour, Bolans village has local barbers who serve the community.
*   **Pro Tip:** Ask the security guards or taxi drivers at the Jolly Harbour commercial center; they know exactly who is cutting in Bolans today.

### Mobile Services
Because Jolly Harbour is full of villas, mobile barbers are a popular option here.
*   **Convenience:** They come to your villa.
*   **Price:** Expect to pay a premium (often $40-$60 USD) for the convenience.

### Heading to Town?
If you're catching the bus or driving into St. John's, it's only a 20-minute drive (traffic permitting). This opens up the full directory of [St. John's barbers](/browse?neighborhood=st-johns).
